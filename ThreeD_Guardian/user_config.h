// Assumes we are using Arduino Nano
// ATTENTION: in Arduino Nano, pins A6 and A7 cannot be used as digital pins (only as analogue input pins)
// The pins 0 and 1 (Rx0 and Tx1) are reserved for serial communications with the WiFi module (esp8266 nodemcu devkit v0.9, or similar).
// Don't use the Arduino's 3.3V out voltage for ESP - it doen't have the power to drive the ESP module. Instead, get the "esp8266 nodemcu devkit v0.9"
// module (3.50$ on ebay) and power it by +5V you can take from the Arduino Nano. (So both Arduino and ESP will be powered by a single micro USB cable.)

const byte SOUND_PIN = 2; // Speaker pin (digital out); needs some elements to be usable for a piezo buzzer control
const byte FAN_PIN = 3; // Pin to control the exhaust fan in the printer's enclosure (connect it to the control - PWM - wire of a 4-wire fan)

// Stepper driver pins (exhaust outlet control); in A4988 driver, connect RESET pin to the adjacent SLEEP pin, and use 100uF capacitor across the motor voltage pins
// ( https://www.pololu.com/product/1182 )
// The DIR pin of the driver has to be connected to either +5V or Ground, for the desired direction of the motor move (from the default state - exhaust closed, to exhaust open)
const byte SLEEP_PIN = 10; // Control of Sleep function of the stepper motor driver (A4988, EasyDriver and similar); LOW: disable motor; HIGH: enable motor; needs 1ms delay after waking up
const byte STEP_PIN = 11; // Control of Step for the motor driver

const byte SSR_PIN = 12; // Pin to control the solid state relay in the external power module (to shut down the printer in case of alarm)
const byte LEDY_PIN = 13; // Yellow LED (training mode) pin (TX1), via 220 Ohm

// Analogue pins:
const byte BUTTONS_PIN = A0; // The analog input pin for the buttons on the display
// The remaining seven analogue pins (A1 ... A7) of Arduino Nano are assigned to up to seven environment sensors below (in "Sensor stuff")

/* Sensor stuff (between one and six sensors with Arduino Nano)
   Types are as follows:
     - 0: raw data sensors (range 0...1023): smoke (MQ-2), CO (MQ-8), etc.
     - 1: alarm thermistors (using Celsius degrees)
     - 2: enclosure thermistor (used both for alarms and for the thermostate - keeps the temperature inside the printer cabinet constant by operating the fan)
     - 3: resistance sensor (current sensor + voltage sensor) - for heated bed or hot end
     - 4: SSR temperature (C; received from ESP via serial connection everyt second)
   Attention: type=3 sensors will not be enabled until they are manually trained from the menu, "Training"/"Init current" (detecting the raw current sensor measurement for zero current)
   Currently only one resistance sensor is supported. Resistance sensors use two analogue pins (for current and voltage sensing, .pin and .pin2, respectively).
   Voltage divider for the voltage sensing part should be such that the heated bed voltage (say, 15V) would be converted to Arduino-safe voltage (<5V), accounting for potential spikes
   in the measured voltage. Don't use smoothing capacitors here as we use very fast (~14 us) voltage/current sensing. E.g., if your voltage is 15V, use R1=39k and R2=10k (R1 is connected
   to +Vin), which will divide by ~5x, so 15V becomes ~3V (=626 in raw units).

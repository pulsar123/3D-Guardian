   to 0...1V range required by the ESP chip (https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit). This creats a pulldown resistor of 320k on A0 pin.
   This needs to be corrected for. If your board doesn't have this issue, put a very large number here (1e9). But then it is your responsibility
   to wire your thermistor in such a way that ESP chip will not get >1V.
